                        Communication with BS 100


	1. Main differences between BS500 and BS100
           a. STX-ETX not the same
	   b. Timeing info for lockers
	   c. 2 bits per box in answer
           d. Extra short answer with up to 4 boxes
           e. Even parity


	2. Half duplex is used. 12 V.

        3. 4096 baud, 8 data-bits, 1 stop-bit and even parity
           Checksum is calculated as a digit 0 - $FF
           The result of calculation including STX, ETX, and
           checksum digit must be = 00

        4. Receive to BS100

           1. STX = $F2
           2. BS number from 0x00(=BS first box 0000) to 0x99(BS 9900) 
              in BCD format max 100
           3. Box number 0x00-0x99 for box-order otherwise = $FF (BCD)
           4. Command
                00 Poll
                01 Close box
                02 Box-order 
                03 -
                04 Poll for long status
                05 Reset BS
           5. ETX = $F3
           6. Cksm 

           Ex. order box 1045
           $F2,$10,$45,$02,$F3,$C4
           Ex. normal poll
           $F2,$10,$FF,$00,$F3,$0C
      

 




        5. Transmit from BS100.

           Answer can be three different messages.

           Short message is send as an answer to all
           incoming messages except number 04.
           
           Long message is send as an answer to 04

           If a hatch has been opened or closed the
           long message or message with 4 boxes will
           be sent as an answer to a poll (00).

           Short message: (third byte = ETX)

           1. STX = $E2
           2. BS number = the same as the received.
           3. ETX = $E3
           4. Cksm

           Ex 
           $E2,$48,$E3,$F3


	   Message with up to for boxes (Third byte = 0 to 99)
           1. STX = $E2
           2. BS number = the same as the received.
           3. Boxnumber1 0x00 to 0x99 BCD
	   4. Status for this box
           5. Boxnumber2 0x00 to 0x99 Optional
	   6. Status for this box       -"-
           7. Boxnumber3 0x00 to 0x99   -"-
	   8. Status for this box       -"-
           9. Boxnumber4 0x00 to 0x99   -"-
	  10. Status for this box       -"-
          11. ETX = $E3
          12. Cksm
 
           This message can be 6 to 12 bytes.
           In the status byte 2 bits are used (LSB)
           0x00 Box closed
           0x02 Box open
           0x03 Box set as faulty. Not used in RBM. This flag is set
                inside the RBM program.
	   
           Ex 
           $E2,$48,$00,$02,$50,$00,$E3,$A1
           Box 4800 opened, box 4850 closed

           Long message (third byte = 0xE7)

           1. STX = $E2
           2. BS number = the same as the received.
           3. $E7 = code for long message
           4. 25 bytes box-info
           5. ETX = $E3
           6. Cksm

           Ex (with all 100 boxes open)
           $E2,$48,$E7,25 of $AA,$E3,$72

           25 bytes is used as 2 bit / box = 2*100/8 = 25 byte
           Box 000 is two MSB in the first byte and box 99 is two LSB bit
           in byte 25.
	   The two bits are as the status byte in earlier message.

           If any of this bytes = ETX or STX  then it is changed,
           for example $E2 is sent as $A5+$1D, 2 characters.
           The second is the inverse of the character
